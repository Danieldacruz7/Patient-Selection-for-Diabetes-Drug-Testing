### Project Motivations:

 A unicorn healthcare startup created a diabetes drug that is ready for clinical trial testing. The drug is highly sensitive and requires administration over a period of 5-7 days while the patient is in hospital. Frequent monitoring and adherence training will be made possible with the help of a mobile application.

 The startup needs to identify patients that need to take part in the study. A model needs to be built to estimate the hospitalization time for a patient, as well as filter patients for the study. The model would ideally be unbiased across gender and different ethnic groups.

### Installations:

 The following libraries will be used in the project.

 1. Numpy
 2. Pandas
 3. Aequitas
 4. Tensorflow
 5. Matplotlib
 6. Tensorflow Probablity

### File Descriptions:

 The main file, student_project.ipynb, contains the most important information for the project. The code and results of the project can be viewed here. The accompanying functions necessary for the project and be viewed in the student_utils.py file.
